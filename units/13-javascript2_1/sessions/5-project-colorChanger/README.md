### Step 1) Setting up your environment
Create a GitHub repo and clone a Cloud9 workspace for this project.

**Part one:** Create a new [GitHub](http://www.github.com) repo called color_changer

**Part two:** Open up your new repository in [Cloud9](http://www.c9.io).


Once the workspace has been processed check to be sure it is up to date by running ` git status ` in the terminal. You should receive a messege telling you that your branch is up to date.

**NOTE: It is common practice to push you changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub.**

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

### Step 2) Make an Array
Create an array of 6 colors with the varible name "colors"

### Step 3) Include jquery
You'll need to include a jquery DOM in your HTML

### Step 4) Create a button
Make a button that, when clicked, changes the background color to a new color in your array.

### Step 5) Print out all of the colors
Make a button that, when clicked, prints out all of the colors that are in your array.

### Step 6) Even more buttons!
Make a button for each color in your array that changes the background to that color.

_Hint: you'll want to make a separate function for making a button_
